Subject: This is the first project I ever did in R; it is pretty much what started it all. The project was my final for my Applied Stats/Econometrics course at OCU for my undergrad. The goal of this project was to predict final placements at Olympic kayak races based on a racer's performance during during the heats and semi-finals.
